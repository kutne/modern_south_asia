## Participation
### What is "Participation" anyway?
This is your single most important “civic responsibility” within the course. In this class, we are a community of individuals collectively pursuing intellectual growth. As such, each member of this scholarly community has a responsibility to themselves and the other members to complete all relevant assignments and to come to class meetings prepared to discuss the reading respectfully and honestly. As an introductory level class, assigned readings will usually be between 50-70 pages a week. We have to cover a lot of ground in this course! We can only manage that successfully if every student completes all assigned work before the start of the class for which it is assigned. The participation grade includes attendance, completing all assigned preparation (including annotations and reading), in-class activities, cluster discussions, quizzes, and written homework. 

### Reading for a Survey Course  

Moving your eyeballs across a text is not reading. Assigned reading make up the bulk of your preparation for this course, so it is critical that you do more than mechanically move through the pages. Yes, this does mean it will take longer. Check out [Reading a Textbook for True Understanding](https://www.cornellcollege.edu/academic-support-and-advising/academic-support/study-tips/reading-textbooks.shtml) for excellent advice that will serve you your entire college career. When you come to class, you should bring both your notes and the [annotated](https://learningcenter.unc.edu/tips-and-tools/annotating-texts/) reading with you. Don’t be afraid to experiment with [note-taking techniques](https://learningcenter.unc.edu/tips-and-tools/taking-notes-while-reading/) if what you are doing isn’t working for you. 

### Annotating Readings 
Reading is also not a passive activity. In addition to improving your comprehension and recall, when you [annotate a text](https://learningcenter.unc.edu/tips-and-tools/annotating-texts/) you will be better able to ask specific questions about the readings. Unlike your standard message board discussions, with this form of “social annotation” you can engage with your peers directly on the text and (only if you want!) you can easily include [pictures and videos](https://web.hypothes.is/adding-links-images-and-videos/) using Markdown.  You will have the chance to share and get feedback on your annotation, as well as compare approaches in homework assignments. 

## Primary Source Analyses

Beginning in week 2, we will work together examining and interpreting a primary source as a class. Over the course of the term, you will practice these skills on your own by submitting 3 primary source analyses, each of which is worth 10% of your grade. Each analysis should be 3-4 pages long. More directions will follow on a separate handout. _You may choose to rewrite one of the three primary source analyses for a higher grade_. This optional rewrite is due on the last day of class and must include a revision memo explaining what changes you made and why.

**Analyses #1 and #2 (10% each)**

I will assign and distribute the sources for the first two sources. Everyone will have the same sources and access to the same information. Primary sources will be assigned 1 week before the rough draft deadline. The purpose of this assignment is to analyze the source without knowing who wrote it, when it was written, or why. No outside research is permitted. This assignment requires that you think like a historian by constructing an argument with contextual clues within the document.

**Museum Visits for Analysis #3 (15%)**

In week 3 you will choose 3 items from a list of items on display at a local museums. Over the course of the semester you should go in person to view each of these items and complete a very brief write-up of your trips. You will have 8 weeks during which you should arrange to visit the appropriate museums. The absolute latest you may submit your write up is Week 11. Your final primary source analysis,  you shall choose one of these items to examine. 

Note: in the event of another Covid-19 shut down, I will provide alternative instructions regarding the museum visit.

## Final Exam
You will receive a take-home, cumulative final exam two weeks before the due date on the syllabus.  The exam will be open book, but you must complete all work independently. Please note: There is no midterm exam in this course.


## A Note on "Clusters"…
In the first or second week of class, I will use a randomizer to assign small groups of 3-4 students. These will be your “clusters” for the semester. The clusters serve a few purposes. In order to ensure that class discussions are as productive as possible in the limited time we have together, I will often ask you to first work through a couple of questions in this small group. Then, you can zoom in on what are the most important questions or ideas you need answers to. 

Why do this with assigned clusters? Why not just count off in each class or ask you to work with whoever is sitting near you? There are a few reasons. First, it saves time. Instead of using precious class time to either make or assign groups, I can just ask you to work with your cluster. If we’re meeting person, you don’t need to figure out who is who. If we’re meeting virtually, then it saves time for setting up Zoom breakout rooms or setting up Google docs.

The second reason, and arguably the more important reason, is that you will develop a rapport with your cluster over the course of the semester. It’s easier to ask questions or work through a set of prompts when you already know each other. For this same reason, it eliminates the disadvantage of not having a friend in the class. When you take a class with someone you already know, then you probably would email or text that person for notes when you missed class with a bad cold or when you have a super quick question about an assignment. This is precisely what your cluster is for. Sometimes I will ask you to meet with your cluster outside of class for a homework assignment, but I also encourage you to get together (virtually or in-person) on your own as well to study and prepare for class. As always, if you have any questions or concerns about this, let me know!
