## About
If history is truly written by the victors, how do they establish their version of events? And what options do the so-called ‘losers’ have to elbow their experiences into the history books? This course introduces students to the history of the countries we know today as India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh. We explore this history through the lens of history making at the intersection of violence, heritage, and politics. We will study the memorialization of massacres and assassinations as mechanisms of state power and subversive tools of resistance in the region. From the Black Hole of Calcutta (1756) and the Mutiny of 1857, the Jallianwala Bagh Massacre (1919) to the murder Mahatma Gandhi (1948), we consider how individuals and states transform traumas into collective cultural inheritance by erecting memorials, advertising tourism circuits, curating museum exhibits, and celebrating tragic anniversaries.

Organized chronologically, the course equips students with a basic knowledge of the region’s history from the establishment of the Mughal Empire in 1526 to the end of British colonial rule in 1947. Through weekly primary source analysis lessons, students will learn how to do the work of history. Even when discussing histories that seem remote from our current moment, we will repeatedly return to the question “what is at stake?” when we tell a particular history. Students will consider what constitutes a “usable” past and interrogate the how historical actors have leveraged the past. This course assumes no prior study of South Asia.

## Objectives  
At the end of the course, you will be able to:
- _Demonstrate_ a basic chronological understanding of modern South Asian history from 1526-1947 – in other words, you will be able to write and speak clearly about major events in the past and explain why they are important;
- _Recognize_ history as an incomplete process – that is continually made and remade by humans for complex reasons – as a means to interpret the past;
- _Identify_, _summarize_, and _appraise_ contradictory perspectives and conflicting historical evidence; 
- _Evaluate_ and _contextualize_ primary and secondary source materials in relation to their historical moment, the themes of course, and historiographical significance.

## Readings

There are 3 required books for this course. All of the books should be available for under $100 USD whether purchased new or used. If you have any concerns regarding the cost of these texts, please let me know. Since copies ordered online may not arrive in time for the second class, the initial readings will be available online. One copy of each book is on reserve at the library.

All other materials will be available online, either via link or uploaded online. I encourage students to check that you can locate and access assigned materials well before the due date.

### What is "Participation" anyway?
This is your single most important “civic responsibility” within the course. In this class, we are a community of individuals collectively pursuing intellectual growth. As such, each member of this scholarly community has a responsibility to themselves and the other members to complete all relevant assignments and to come to class meetings prepared to discuss the reading respectfully and honestly. As an introductory level class, assigned readings will usually be between 50-70 pages a week. We have to cover a lot of ground in this course! We can only manage that successfully if every student completes all assigned work before the start of the class for which it is assigned. The participation grade includes attendance, completing all assigned preparation (including annotations and reading), in-class activities, cluster discussions, quizzes, and written homework. 

#### Reading for a Survey Course  

Moving your eyeballs across a text is not reading. Assigned reading make up the bulk of your preparation for this course, so it is critical that you do more than mechanically move through the pages. Yes, this does mean it will take longer. Check out [Reading a Textbook for True Understanding](https://www.cornellcollege.edu/academic-support-and-advising/academic-support/study-tips/reading-textbooks.shtml) for excellent advice that will serve you your entire college career. When you come to class, you should bring both your notes and the [annotated](https://learningcenter.unc.edu/tips-and-tools/annotating-texts/) reading with you. Don’t be afraid to experiment with [note-taking techniques](https://learningcenter.unc.edu/tips-and-tools/taking-notes-while-reading/) if what you are doing isn’t working for you.
