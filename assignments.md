### What is "Participation" anyway?
This is your single most important “civic responsibility” within the course. In this class, we are a community of individuals collectively pursuing intellectual growth. As such, each member of this scholarly community has a responsibility to themselves and the other members to complete all relevant assignments and to come to class meetings prepared to discuss the reading respectfully and honestly. As an introductory level class, assigned readings will usually be between 50-70 pages a week. We have to cover a lot of ground in this course! We can only manage that successfully if every student completes all assigned work before the start of the class for which it is assigned. The participation grade includes attendance, completing all assigned preparation (including annotations and reading), in-class activities, cluster discussions, quizzes, and written homework. 

#### Reading for a Survey Course  

Moving your eyeballs across a text is not reading. Assigned reading make up the bulk of your preparation for this course, so it is critical that you do more than mechanically move through the pages. Yes, this does mean it will take longer. Check out [Reading a Textbook for True Understanding](https://www.cornellcollege.edu/academic-support-and-advising/academic-support/study-tips/reading-textbooks.shtml) for excellent advice that will serve you your entire college career. When you come to class, you should bring both your notes and the [annotated](https://learningcenter.unc.edu/tips-and-tools/annotating-texts/) reading with you. Don’t be afraid to experiment with [note-taking techniques](https://learningcenter.unc.edu/tips-and-tools/taking-notes-while-reading/) if what you are doing isn’t working for you. 

#### Annotating Readings 
Reading is also not a passive activity. In addition to improving your comprehension and recall, when you [annotate a text](https://learningcenter.unc.edu/tips-and-tools/annotating-texts/) you will be better able to ask specific questions about the readings. Unlike your standard message board discussions, with this form of “social annotation” you can engage with your peers directly on the text and (only if you want!) you can easily include [pictures and videos](https://web.hypothes.is/adding-links-images-and-videos/) using Markdown.  You will have the chance to share and get feedback on your annotation, as well as compare approaches in homework assignments.
